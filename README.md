# OS_HW2
This C++ code implements a simple lottery scheduling algorithm using object-oriented programming concepts. It defines two classes:'Process' which is representing a process with attributes for ID and number of lottery tickets, and 'Scheduler' which is managing the scheduling algorithm with methods for adding processes, allocating tickets based on proportions, and selecting a winner process using a random number generator. In the main function, processes are created with IDs and ticket counts, added to the scheduler, tickets are allocated, and a winning process is randomly selected and displayed. The code demonstrates the lottery scheduling algorithm by assigning and selecting a winner among the processes based on their respective numbers of tickets.
